# DSi World
A Spring-backed website created for use by the DSi.  
Right now, there's not much on there, but I plan to put a lot of cool things on here at point or another.

## Cool things in the works  
These are things that either people have suggested or I thought might be cool to have on a DSi.
 - DSi-compatible email client
 - Git-like command line with in-built editor
 - Manga reader
