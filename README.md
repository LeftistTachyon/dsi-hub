# DSi World
A Spring-backed website created for use by the DSi.  
Right now, there's not much on there, but I plan to put a lot of cool things on here at point or another.

## Cool things in the works  
These are things that either people have suggested or I thought might be cool to have on a DSi.
 - DSi-compatible email client
 - Git-compatible version control GUI with in-built editor
   - Using JGit on the server side, and the web page to direct the server.
   - Using [this page](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JGit/article.html) as a tutorial.
   - It would also probably be good to look at [the cookbook](https://github.com/centic9/jgit-cookbook/).
 - Manga reader
   - Pulls from Manga Panda given an identifier or a search term
   - Allows navigation of episodes and individual pages, with scaling to ensure that the device doesn't run out of memory rendering the image
 - Calculator
   - At least 4-function, maybe even scientific?
   - If I can emulate Desmos' scientific calculator, that'd be AWESOME
